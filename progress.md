# Progress

This page will be dedicated the progress of the company website being developed. As there are many things about this blog that I must learn and edit as I develop a better understanding of Jekyll and running it on Github through Github Pages.


## Issues

This section will be covering all the issues that are on this blog. I will be going over each one that I come across in this section. As I learn how to implement and adapt with the Jekyll made website. 

1. The posts don't show up on the front page. 
    The posts aren't showing on the front page, which makes it very difficult to see any of the new posts that I have written.
2. The footer needs to be fixed
    The footer section of this website needs to be adjusted, as it looks very obtuse.
    
## Changes

The following are the necessary changes that need to be implemented in order for me to have progress moving forward. I will be needing to replace the favicon and the avatar images and replace them with on more personalized.


## To-Do

1. Change the favicon and the avatar icons
2. Add the posts page and create an index of the posts that have been posted.
3. Add a contacts page with a contact form.
