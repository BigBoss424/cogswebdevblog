## Identifying Productivity and Lack of Productivity

I am going to build software once I get a handle on a steady workflow, so I can learn to procedurally handle the events that come up with trying to not only get this blog in working order but the rest of the projects that I had previously started and need to complete as well.

As I write, I am learning and realizing that there are a plethora of subjects and concepts that I have not been able to fully grasp and understand until now. All I have to do is continue to build and practice with what I have plenty. I know that I have to begin reading more often, when it comes to learning so that I can better implement what I have gone over and remember that I can train my mind to remember and to implement solutions to common problems. There is no one size fits all solution to every problem that I come across. Thankfully there are programmers and developers that are helping create the tools that I use to be able to learn.

## Strategies to Improve Productivity

The understanding that patience is a key factor in learning. Having the ability to document the shortcomings and issues, alongside the solutions is where I can improve my productivity. Which will be today's focus as I continue to learn and develop actual programming design patterns, paradigms and methodologies to create applications that can help benefit others.
