## Errors and AI

As I start today, I came across an error when running ClamAV on my machine. It gave me an error code of,


```
LibClamAV Error: cli_loaddbdir: No supported database files found in /var/lib/clamav 
```

To which I fixed by running the following command: 

```
sudo freshclam
```

I don't know exactly what it does but I think it updates the virus database for clamav. It's slowly coming back to me. I created three videos for spreading the Gospel but the software that I was using stopped working after the third video.

To counter this, I am going to try to create my own AI that creates the videos from text. Though it will take me a very long time for me to create such a tool. I'll start with baby steps, by building the software tools I need to create for me to function. 

I would like to create today an application that specifically plays back some of my favorite TV shows and movies. I am going to try to attempt to create this application to be able to share my current media with not only myself but with others.
