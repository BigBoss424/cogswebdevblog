## Maintainance

Maintainance of my machines has always been a struggle but I have hope now that I have learned about crontabs and cronjobs. I plan on utilizing them to build an automated schedule of tasks that need to be performed on a daily basis. I will be placing them in my [Arch Linux Repo](https://www.github.com/bigboss424/archlinux). I will also be working on creating bash scripts for Arch Linux and EndeavorOS, as they are the basis of my current machine and will be also in the [Arch Linux Repo](https://www.github.com/bigboss424/archlinux), be sure to visit it for more information. The goal is to have each category of software found on my machine itemized into their appropriate install script, to ensure that the software can be installed if I were to do a complete reinstall of another distro (Variations of Arch Linux). I do enjoy the platform of Arch Linux, and love utilizing it. I plan on ricing my machine with i3wm and such to help me boost my productivity and help reduce some of the system resources that are being used up by my current Desktop Environment, Cinnamon. Though, I have nothing against Cinnamon, I do miss the sleak and fast performance of i3wm when it's fully setup properly. My favorite configuration comes from the i3wm-Manjaro Linux distro. Something about tiling always seems to make things much more efficient on a machine.
