## Maintainance

Maintainance of my machines has always been a struggle but I have hope now that I have learned about crontabs and cronjobs. I plan on utilizing them to build an automated schedule of tasks that need to be performed on a daily basis. I will be placing them in my [Arch Linux Repo](https://www.github.com/bigboss424/archlinux). I will also be working on creating bash scripts for Arch Linux and EndeavorOS, as they are the basis of my current machine and will be also in the [Arch Linux Repo](https://www.github.com/bigboss424/archlinux), be sure to visit it for more information. The goal is to have each category of software found on my machine itemized into their appropriate install script, to ensure that the software can be installed if I were to do a complete reinstall of another distro (Variations of Arch Linux). I do enjoy the platform of Arch Linux, and love utilizing it. I plan on ricing my machine with i3wm and such to help me boost my productivity and help reduce some of the system resources that are being used up by my current Desktop Environment, Cinnamon. Though, I have nothing against Cinnamon, I do miss the sleak and fast performance of i3wm when it's fully setup properly. My favorite configuration comes from the i3wm-Manjaro Linux distro. Something about tiling always seems to make things much more efficient on a machine. 

### Cronjobs 

I will be learning how to utilize cronjobs and crontabs on both my Arch Linux machine and my Raspberry Pi. The goal is to automate simple tasks such as updating and upgrading the system and eventually to the management of Github Repositories. 

I will expand upon this further as I implement them today. 

### Bash Scripting

Now I find it imperative to relearn and reinforce my skills in bash scripting to help me build scripts to better manage my linux machines. I would like to eventually build scripts that implement that GUI aspect utilizing whiptail, I believe that's what it's called. For the time being though I will be developing my script solutions strictly in the terminal.

I will utilizing the resources from, [Awesome Linux](https://github.com/BigBoss424/awesome-linux), my personalized fork. Specifically I will be looking in the 
## Documentation 

Documentation wise, I am seeing alternatives to the Github Repo Wiki and utilizing options such as Gitbook and Docusaurus. Using Gitbook seems to be the easiest route for the time being, as setting up Docusaurus will take longer to implement, as Gitbook was ready, somewhat instantly. I like the structure of Gitbook so far, and plan on utilizing as my primary means of documentation for both my personal use and business use.

Though I am still open to utilizing the Wiki on the Github Repo, I find it necessary to keep good documentation when it comes to developing the software and websites that I am working on. Though I seem to get lost in the process of creating the documentation though, and lose sight of development at times.
