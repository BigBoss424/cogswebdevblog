## Developing Once Again
Learning how to progress myself from a coder to a programmer is a lot of work but I think it will be worth it towards the end. I am learning a variety of different technologies and being exposed to a lot of techniques and methodologies that I thought I had an understanding of but didn't fully grasp until now. 

Take for example this site, making it easier for me to write an update for this development blog. There have been tools that I haven't been using or rather have been blind to this entire time and now realizing that I have been kinda of a fool for taking my development route at such a snails pace. I believe though by better managing my time, I will be able to gain mastery over these languages and technologies that the web consists of. There are technologies such as Angular.js, React.js, Node.js, PHP, Symphony, and many more that I am barely gaining a understanding of. 

I have been struggling the past couple days understanding the concepts of HTML5 DOM Manipulation and manipulating my HTML DOM utilizing Javascript. I also have taken the time to start learning TypeScript and believe that teaching myself Java, C, C++, C#, and Python will prove to be useful over the next couple of years. I find it difficult to keep on track with all the different ideas that flow through my mind when it comes to developing software, websites, and web applications. Though, I think by implementing CMS technologies such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal will become a necessity over time, as the demand for me building and utilizing blogs to maintain my documentation of my learning process overtime will be crucial to my skill growth as time moves forward.

I am coupling my life problems with programming to come up with solutions to my own personal and business problems over time as well. Such as building small applications such as a timer, calculator, conversion calculators, and applications to help me log and keep better track of my day to day activities so that way I can increase my productivity. 

I also plan on reimplementing apps such as Todoist, Trello, and a few others to better help me keep on track with my tasks and goals over the next coming weeks. I want to be able to rebuild and restore my business in order to be able to handle clients from all over and actually be able to keep up with the demands of said cliental. I want to be able to provide a very stable and reliable service toward my customers but I first have to lay down the foundation of the company by developing it's IT Infrastructure to better be able to handle the needs of a business. I will be breaking that down in a later post as well. 

I need to implement and utilize the tools on Github to it's fullest and that includes learning Github Actions for CLI Continuous Integration to better manage my day to day tasks such as updating repos, merging branches, updating dependancies, and pushing and pulling commits from the repos. It's interesting to see all the new and innovative ways in which I can launch my business and projects online. I simply have to continue to find new ways to innovate how I go about building and developing my software applications over time. I can't allow myself to stay stuck on one language or technology for too long because I feel that I have fallen far behind with my abilities that I thought I had, left me not knowing how to actually develop software that people would like to use. 

I will also be reaching out to IRC channels to recruit people into my business as, I realize now that I cannot do this all by myself and I need more people to help me build this business into a fully well oiled machine. Not just for the profit but to be able to change the way I and industry go about our business. I will be working on a draft of my business structure once I get it down on pen and paper.
