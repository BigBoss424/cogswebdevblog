I am beginning to realize that the necessity for a home base in the form of developing an Intranet on the Internet is quite necessary. As I find myself needing to rely upon the resources of the Internet more often to delegate the processing power, memory allocation and other resources to ensure my machine doesn't get bogged down.

I will be doing a lot more research into creating and developing data pipelines and other dev ops methods to better organize my data and increase my productivity.

## React.js

I decided today to learn how to use React.js. A popular framework that is being used in web development today. Unlike it's counterparts such as Vue.js or Angular.js, React.js offers me a new way to develop websites. Though there are a lot of different methods and techniques that comprise React.js it seems fairly straight forward after trying it out.

I kinda like the idea that I can develop an application based upon the state of the data and build it in a similar fashion to how applications are built on Java and C++. Though I do admit that I am barely touching the surface of the development world of thinking considering that I am barely gaining mastery over HTML, CSS and Javascript. Though I am gaining a better appreciation of Javascript and it's frameworks. As well as all the other languages that I thought that I was fluent in.
