## A Lack of Schedule

A lack of a schedule has lead me to have a slowdown in how much I can work on the company site and the time necessary to take in order to learn how to develop the site in the manner in which I believe it would best be served. I am learning that I need to breakdown the workload into smaller portions in order to make the workload much easier and managable.

I will be seeking advice on how to create a master schedule with all the items from multiple calendars. As well, creating the calendars necessary in order to build an efficient timeline and manner in which I can properly execute a proper development cycle and learn production. Rather than haphazardly releasing content, programs, scripts, websites, and web applications. 

## Project Management

Having an understanding of project management from what I know and what I am learning requires a lot. Rather a variety of software, I will be building the necessary documents and measures in order to promote a more efficient workflow. Utilizing both intranet and internet solutions to build a proper workflow where I can produce a wide variety of content, programs, websites, and web applications. Learning methodologies to help me produce software such as Agile, Scrum and development cycles has opened my eyes to the lack of structure that I have with my development process.

## Training

After carefully analyzing my current skills, I have learned that I require a lot of training in order for me to catch-up and keep up with the changes in the technology sector and how that transitions into all the other sectors. As I continue my education, I am learning that I have to apply the theoretical theories that are covered in the education material into real world applications. Which in turn, I am trying to document and record in order to build and grow the companies social media presence.

## Valentine's Day

Valentine's Day, makes me realize that I desperately need a calendar and notifications in order to remember the days in which the holidays are, as they are opportunities to build software, websites, and web applications that can be targeted towards the holiday. I have to get smarter in my approach of development.
