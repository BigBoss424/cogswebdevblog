## Learning Programming and FullStack Development

Learning how to program from scratch is literally a very fun and interesting experience on a daily basis. As I audit courses online, via websites like (EdX)[https://www.edx.org] has helped me gain further education in the areas that I find to be my weaknesses. I am learning to build tools and things of that nature that will better help and serve to better my skills as an aspiring web developer.

### IT Infrastructure and Development

IT infrastructure has been one of my core focus as I learn more about the resources that are currently available and where I can make improvements upon. I would like to take the time to dedicate in learning about microservices and how they are implemented in Kubernates and Docker containers. In order to consolidate all the resources that I am currently using in order to build and maintain all the sites and learn to develop them into dynamic websites by learning to integrate both NoSQL and SQL databases. Ensuring that I have the tools in order to manage all my resources is somewhat tricky, as I have to learn how to develop a control panel customized toward my use, which would be a real nice addition to help me manage all the resources.

### Creating Efficiency via Cronjobs and Bash Scripting

I started to realize, that I can automate a lot of my daily tasks via cronjobs and bash scripting. The tasks that I find daunting such as building scripts to manage bulk creation of folders and folders. As well as the means to create a sense of order when it comes to security. I think things will become clearer as I continue the courses on FreeCodeCamp and Edx. Meanwhile, I have to continue to learn about different aspects in regards to the security and privacy setting within local system, EndeavourOS and my servers, CentOS and Debian. As I learn how to automate certain tasks and jobs that are a part of system maintainance.

Generating documentation is going to become difficult, as it takes a lot of time to input and generate the articles.
