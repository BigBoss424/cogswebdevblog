## Automation and AI

Today is and was a very unique learning experience. I have learned that there are tools that can make my life a whole lot easier if I simply learn to implement them. The tools being AI and automation. I never utilized a CI/CLI Pipeline which is probably one of the main reasons why my workflow is so slow. I need to hasten my workflow and build up the knowledge and learn how to utilize tools such as Github Actions, Jenkins, and Travis CLI tools. In order for me to build and produce software and websites that everyone can use and utilize. I need to learn how to utilize AI tools as well to build better content at a applicable rate. 

Using my programming skills to help me maintain and gain profit is the ideal situtation that I would like to be in. I need to learn to reach out and ask for help. I can't build my company, let alone any of the tasks that I set before me. I won't allow myself to fall further behind and I will gain the education necessary to move myself and those around me further. 

## Evolve With The Challenges

I will improve every single day, regardless of my caveats. I have shortcomings, but I will turn these shortcomings into an advantage and move forward. I constantly find myself having to read and digest information each and every single day. Whether it be from a paperback book to the digital screen. I am always and constantly learning. The rough part about constantly learning is implementing methods and ways in which I can make a profit. I need to work in order for myself to maintain the lifestyle that I currently have. 

I must work each and every single day, in order to build a better promising future and have to set aside my own wants and needs in order for me to reach this goal. That is the process in which I evolve into building better habits and those habits will help me grow. As such I gotta learn to take breaks and implement better solutions to the issues that I currently have. 

## Working Smarter, not Harder

At times I feel that I have been working a lot harder than smarter. Especially when there are tools available and ready to make the process a whole lot easier to create the company that I am building. Rather since I was so focused on building a company, I feel that I neglected creating the foundation for my business to stay afloat in times like these. As such, I am learning to build a more solid and concise foundation to ensure that there are failsafes set in place in case of events that are out of my control. 

Which is why I found automation and AI such an interesting learning topic today. I never realized how utilizing such technology would help lessen my workload. Though I still have a lot to learn when it comes to building software and websites. Each day I am finding it easier and easier by learning how to utilize tools that already exist and actually understanding how they work rather than simply glance over tutorial after tutorial. 

That way the knowledge stays in my head and I will be able to reach for it when the time comes. Day by day, I have to learn something new or at least refine what I do know and learn to build and create software and hardware solutions that can be applied to my real world issues to help not only better me but anyone else who could use the help.
