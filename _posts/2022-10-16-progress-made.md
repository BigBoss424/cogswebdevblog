## Progress Made Today

Today I spent most of the day going over coding tutorials and courses on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and on Github. I found out there is this new concept called No Code. In which all the development of the website is done the a WYSIWGI editor. This new discovery has made me very happy as I have been somewhat struggling to learn to build websites for the past couple of years by learning various of tools that are involved with building a website. 

### No Code Editors
The No Code editors that I found to be inspiring as I have been finding the process of building Cogs Web Development and Hosting from scratch a very daunting task. Some of the No Code editors that I have found include [webFlow](https://www.webflow.com), [GrapeJS](https://www.graphjs.com), and [builder.io](https://www.builder.io). I am personally going to try out builder.io and webflow to build my websites from now on. As I progressively learn the fundamentals of Web Development and building my IT infrastructure from the ground up. 

### Learning to Program vs Code
Learning how to programming and coding has been a very key concept that I needed to learn a long time ago. I have learned that I lack some very key skills needed to build websites. Luckily for me, there has been a flux in building coding academies and camps developed over the past couple of years. I have been utilizing free online courses to steadily teach myself how to program.As well as developing programs in other languages such as Java, C, C++ and Python. I am learning how to implement these languages in my day to day function as I steadily draw myself closer to building software, web applications and websites that will help me bring in profit.

### Learning Github Actions
Today's hardest task came in the form of utilizing Github Actions on Github. It has been difficult to understand how it works and how to implement it in the fashion I would like. The documentation on it is a hard
read and I still need to take the time to sit down and go over the documentation on how to build Github Actions to automate my workflow when it comes to deploying my Jekyll blogs and static sites that I am hosting on Github for the time being. 

I am also working on understanding the Github Runner feature to come to a better understanding as to what it is that it does. From my understanding it is similar to Github Actions or rather a process within Github Actions to automate deployment of software on Github itself. Learning all these new concepts about CI integration and automation has me perplexed. I will learn how to utilize Github Actions because I would really like to automate the merge process between the master(main) branch and the gh-pages branch on my Jekyll blogs. 

### Headless CMS
I discovered what headless CMS' are and how to utilize them. At the time of writing this article I am utilizing one called [Prose.io](https://www.prose.io). I am using Prose to write my blog posts for this development blog. I am pretty glad that I started to actually try out the different CMS platforms and learning that there are options beyond simply utilizing programming skills. Though I still believe that they are necessary to fully build a functional and functioning website. 

### Serverless Functions
I am also researching how to implement serverless functions using Firebase Functions, and integrating it with Firebase Firestore to develop my companies website. I want to be able to handle features such as payment, authentication and such, as efficiently as possible. I would prefer if I could build the site without having to utilize a database but that seems to be mundane in this day and age. I will be learning how to utilize serverless functions to maintain the functionality of my companies website. For the time being the only functionality that it will be having will be the contact form on the site itself.
