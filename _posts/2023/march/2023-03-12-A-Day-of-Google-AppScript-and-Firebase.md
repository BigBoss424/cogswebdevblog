Today I learned a lot about Google Workspace and Google AppScript. Learning that there is an option to utilize the Google Platform. Such as the Google App Scripts and learning how to further extend the experience of the Google Office Suite. I also learned that there is a way utilizing the Google Office Suite to manage and maintain websites and blogs on the platform itself. I found it very interesting as I am coming to grasp the concepts of automation and learning how to build web applications that can help further my workflow. 

## Google

As I learn more about the Google Platform, utilizing it for the hosting of my companies website and other projects as well. I am coming to a realization that there is a lot of opportunity to make money online and I am learning how to build a system that will help me establish my online presence and maintain it. Creating a variety of tools to help me become more proficient as the technology world seems to be moving really fast and I am barely keeping up with simple websites and blogs for the time being. I am learning how to embrace the design principles of Google so that I can build software that can bolster my personal and business portfolio.

I never thought that I could do a lot and it seems very overwhelming at times but I am going to learn either way how to build the websites and applications that will drive some form of profit to my efforts. I am using the Google Suite, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Forms, and such to build the necessary forms to better prepare myself for leads and such from my website. I am learning how to embrace serverless functions right now to create microservices to have more traffic be driven to the site.

## Firebase

Learning how to use the Firebase platform has been somewhat a challenge for me because I am learning how to utilize the applications that it applies to add functionality to my website. I find myself lost at times trying to utilize it but I know that over time I will become proficient in using it. All I have to do is more research and learn to implement the documentation that is provided. Practicing by building applications usually helps me gain a better perspective on how to build better software. I need to dedicate the time in order to get more done. I will be learning how to use Machine Learning in order to automate a lot of the processes that are redundant in my workflow. 

## The site

The site itself will be static until I add more functionality to it using Firebase Functions and it's Databases. I will be practicing how to use SQL databases in order to have a better understanding of how data is structured. I plan on creating a Domain Registration feature of the site using Ethereum. I am also going to dive into learning Web 3.0 technologies to expand the site further. As well as contributing to the communities online.
