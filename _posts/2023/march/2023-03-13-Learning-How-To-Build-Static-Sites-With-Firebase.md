title: Learning How To Build Static Sites with Firebase
published: true
---

As Firebase is my only option at the moment to build, host, and produce my websites. I will be learning how to utilize the Static Site Generators that are available right now in order to build and expand my network. Using them as a means to add and post more content online to help drive more traffic to my business so that I can start gaining more employment.

I am going to learn how to build my site in a manner that adhere's to an MVC Architecture so that I can better familiarize myself with the architecture and it's implementation on my website. I will be learning all day today but will also be implementing various Firebase Applications toward the site as well. As I have given myself a timer of roughly 17 days. I plan on releasing the site today in order to start building it as I go. Using Node.js, Express.js and Firebase for the rest of the site itself.

I also learned that a lot of the tutorials that I am using are outdated, which is another opportunity to add more to my site to garner more traffic.

## Jekyll

I plan on learning more about Jekyll as well. Learning how to expand the SEO of the blogs that I have on Github. My goal is to create an application to help me better manage the posts of the websites. So that I can start to learn how to automate and make this process a whole lot easier.

Learning how the SSG actually works would benefit me a whole lot better than not knowing how to. 

## Tutorials

As I go through more and more tutorials, my goal is to implement them on my website in order to drive more traffic to the site itself. I will be using Google Sheets to help me scrap the data from the website in order to create the posts and then post them again on a variety of platforms. I'm starting to really like Google App Script. It is a very useful tool to add more power towards my workflow.
