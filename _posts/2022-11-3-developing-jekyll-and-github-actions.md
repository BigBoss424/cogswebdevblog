## Developing Jekyll and Github Actions

As I go about today, I am reminded that it can be difficult to maintain a blog, when there is so much work needed to be done in order to have this blog in working order. I am realizing that even with a static site generator, there is still work that needs to be put into creating the content that comprises the website. As well as managing the pages, and overall structure of the website. I am attempting today to implement Google Analytics unto this site, so that I may get a better analytical perspective of the traffic that is being driven to my site. I plan on utilizing this even for the main page of the business site that I am currently working on. Though it seems that I find myself getting sidetracked because I have to learn a lot about the underlying technologies that comprise the website(s) that I am creating. I do this in order to create a sense of guarentee that the websites that I build and create, even if they are derived from templates can still be functional and utilized for small business purposes and help promote a business.

## Learning Github Actions

Learning Github Actions seems to be a very challenging concept for me. For the reason that I don't fully understand the premise of each part of the Github Action and how it comprises the Action. I plan on building my own workflow utilizing the Github Actions as to make the development process of maintaining this blog much easier by automating the processes that I find mundane and repeatative. I like that it gives me the assurance that I can have a development environment seperate from my own machine to build and deploy the website. I still have a lot to learn when it comes to understanding CI/CD principles and utilizing them in a manner that will help grow and structure my daily business tasks. I hope that some day there will be a tool to better visualize the process of building the workflow but until then I will have to rely on the methods that are available to me now. 

## Decided to use Bootstrap

Using Bootstrap for the front-end framework, is what I decided to do, as I started working on the components that are to comprise my companies website. Though I am having some difficulty moving the button to the right. I think it's due to me not knowing the CSS properties of the framework. It is making developing the main site much more difficult than it should but that's alright, nothing is gained without putting in effort. I have plenty of other ideas of other frameworks that I would like to implement. Such as Angular, Vue, and possibly Next but I need to put in more effort into building a more stable foundation with the core HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript languages first so that I can use and understand the purpose behind post and pre processors.

## Python and Flask

Learning Python and Flask was fun today, though it was absorbing all my time trying understand it. The two gave me a perspective on utilizing languages and web frameworks to build websites. Not solely based upon the principles of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. Though they implement aspects from each language to comprise a larger application utilizing templates. I feel that I am getting closer to the answers I have been seeking for a very long time when it comes to understanding web development and programming as a whole. I even discovered today Zen Coding which makes things a whole lot easier to build and create. Makes me kinda excited to start building programming again and helps me have a more positive outlook as I venture forth towards the end of the year.
