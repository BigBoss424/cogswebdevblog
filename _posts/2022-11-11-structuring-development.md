## Structure

Organizing the structure of my development environments on my local machine, Raspberry Pi and Github somewhat seems to be a challenge. Yet I am learning that there is a way to automate a lot of the processes that I go through on a daily basis to help me cut down the time spent doing redundant tasks over and over again. I am learning how to structure my development environment utilizing my local machine and Raspberry Pi. I want to be able to utilize my Raspberry Pi as a means to automate a majority of the tasks that I need to get done during the day, week, month and year.

Organizing how my data is reliant upon how I organize my file structure on my external drives. I plan on fixing some of the folders and files on my external drive, as to help me better clarify where certain items are located. Lately, I've been to lazy and placing items in whichever folder happens to be present when I am moving files around. I need to break that habit so that I may have a more organized structure when it comes to the structure of my external drives. I also plan on learning how to utilize rsync to help me properly back up certain folders. 

## Development

Development has been somewhat slow, as I am currently struggling to balance the blog posts, and my various projects that I am currently working on. My primary focus is to start building the company website, so that I may start gaining business. Yet I seem to run into a hiccup of sorts, when I get sidetracked by another task or project. There seems to be a wide variety of programs and applications that I am needing to build for my current build. I have found a plethora of files and programs that I think are malicious on my system and that has put me at a stand-still because I have been experiencing a sense of eye's ever watching my moves on the computer. Which is why I have switched over to utilizing Github's Web Editor and Codespaces. Even then, I have my reservations, as to the security of these tools. 

### Java

I have been teaching myself, how to program in Java and utilizing Jetbrains IDEA Community Edition, as my IDE for the development of my programs. I am learning the differences between the variety of GUI frameworks such as Swing and JavaFX. To, what I believe are build tools, Maven and Gradle. Though the internet has been somewhat vague with the definition of these tools, I am slowly learning how to implement them into my daily programming regiment. I plan on learning how to build Java Web Applications, so that I may learn what Java Beans and Java EE is like. My goal is to create some GUI applications for the desktop (primarily Linux-based) that will help me better manage and utilize my Linux distros and keep track of personal data and statistics. 

I have yet to truly expand upon my current knowledge and understanding of Java and want to expand my knowledge base so that I can learn how to pick up Kotlin for building Android applications. I really am looking forward to learning Kotlin, so that I may build some customized tools for my Android phone. This way I can gain some serious applicable use out of my phone. It seems like a very tall order simply learning how to develop again, but as time passes by I am learning to have an appreciation to the knowledge that I do have utilizing Java and look forward to Kotlin in the coming future. 

I will plan on releasing and goal oriented software release schedule for the applications that I am building in Java. Until then I will be learning how to build some necessary applications for my business as well
