## Welcome to the Development Blog

Welcome to Cogs Web Development and Hosting Development Blog. This blog will be utilized to track and log the progress of building the main business website that I will be using for Cogs Web Development and Hosting. I will be working on a variety of different technologies and methodologies to get this website launched in time. It will have a various stages to which it will be at and I plan on outlining them in a Software Development Plan as I learn how to utilize and implement all the software that I am currently using to build the website and the technologies that I utilize for my company. 

## Research

I will be researching different methods, technologies and techniques to broaden the companies website. As it currently stands I have only been able to host static websites, since I have yet to learn how to develop dynamic websites and applications. I will be gaining more traction and practice as time progresses as I am utilizing online code academies and bootcamps to aid in my learning process. 

I am focusing on keeping the technologies and software that I implement into this company site to consist of only open source software. As I am running on a budget of nothing at the current moment and have to start building digital assets for the company to promote and strengthen it's online presence. 

Learning online marketing with SEO and Google Ads is a huge priority for me as I need to drive traffic to not only this company's site but also to all of the assets tied to it's network. I will be needing to create a means of keeping track of all the information that I will be learning over the coming days as I will be needing to reference the information over time. 


## Building Software

I am also working building and developing software for the platforms that I am developing on, as well as hosting on. Such as Bash Install Scripts and calculators to help me keep track of calculations over time. I have been learning Javascript, and have been finding it very interesting to implement as it is very open in regards to it's variable declarations. It is very similiar to C and Python in regards to it's complexity and I plan on continuing to implement it as time progresses. I will be utilizing Python in Jupyter Notebooks that I will be keeping online using Google Collab. 

The Jupyter Notebooks are to help me keep track of progress and scientific measurements and experiments as time progress. I will also be utilizing this time to better understand and utilize Github and Visual Studio Code, so that I may become proficient in my project management skills. 

## Phase 1 - The landing page

Currently the website that is up right now only consists of a landing page with a countdown timer on it. Implemented two buttons on the this site, one that directs users to this development blog and the other to a contact form that they can fill out to get in contact with me about the services the company provides. I plan on adding buttons at the bottom of the countdown interface for social media accounts. I also plan on creating another button in the middle of the two buttons on top of the countdown timer to link to my personal portfolio page. 

## Phase 2 - Landing Page Part 2

I plan on implementing a very basic company landing page for the website. It will be a SPA (Single Page Application) consisting information about the company, services provided, contact form, map location, and very basic and rudimentary design of the site until I learn how to integrate Webmin and VirtualMin for clients. The functionality of this version of the site will be kept at a very minimum as I am still learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS3, and Javascript.
